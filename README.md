# üîê Cybersecurity Lab Portfolio ‚Äì Afaq

Welcome to my personal cybersecurity lab portfolio. As a SOC Analyst and cybersecurity enthusiast, I‚Äôm building hands-on labs to strengthen my skills in threat detection, offensive security, and incident response. This space will showcase my learning journey, tools I've worked with, and practical exercises that reflect real-world scenarios.

## üß™ Lab Projects (In Progress)

### 1. Web Application Penetration Testing *(In Progress)*
- **Tools:** Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, WebGoat, DVWA
- **Focus:** SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, session hijacking
- **Goal:** Identify vulnerabilities and document findings aligned with OWASP Top 10

### 2. Network Exploitation & Post-Exploitation *(Planned)*
- **Tools:** Metasploit Framework, Nmap, Netcat
- **Focus:** Vulnerability scanning, payload delivery, reverse shells, privilege escalation
- **Goal:** Simulate real-world attack scenarios and document exploitation steps

### 3. Threat Hunting & Log Analysis *(In Progress)*
- **Tools:** Elastic SIEM, Kibana, Sysmon, Winlogbeat
- **Focus:** Log correlation, alert creation, dashboarding
- **Goal:** Detect brute-force attempts, suspicious processes, and registry changes in a simulated SOC environment

## üõ†Ô∏è Lab Setup
- **Virtualisation:** VirtualBox with Kali Linux, Windows 10, and Windows 8
- **SIEM Stack:** Elastic Stack with Wazuh integration
- **Monitoring Agents:** Sysmon + Winlogbeat for endpoint telemetry
- 

## üìå Next Steps
- Publishing detailed write-ups and screenshots for each lab
- Expanding into cloud security labs (AWS, Azure)
- Building a public threat detection ruleset for Elastic SIEM
